			<p>I am a highschool student at Arden Anglican School Epping NSW. I work at Koorong West Ryde and I have been building a website. I doubt anyone will read this as this website is not public. You would only see this if I were showing this to you. To add extra words I will find a word document or something and I will copy and past whatever is there. The Sperm Story:. Sperm start their life in the testes of males. This is their birth place and, at any one time, thousands are produced. Their home is in the testes, where thousands of them share the one spot at any one time. The sperm are protected from harm by the scrotum. Their life span varies greatly, as they can be released in one day if their owner is sexually aroused, or they can survive in the testes for about two months. After this time their ‘used by date’ expires, and they become old and disintegrate to be replaced by thousands of young ones. If their owner is sexually aroused, has a full bladder, is excited, is wearing tight pants, rhythmic movements such as the motion of a car / train or waking up in the morning, the penis swells and becomes erect, which is a signal for the ejaculation process to begin. Sperm then move from the testes into the sperm duct called the vas deferens then up and around to the prostate gland. There, they are mixed with a variety of fluids supplied from the prostate gland, seminal vesicles and Cowpers gland. The prostate gland can be thought of as one big blender, where all these fluids are mixed to form a thick white liquid called semen. Semen is then pushed into the urethra and finally pushed out of the penis. This is called ejaculation. If ejaculation occurs into a women’s vagina, sperm can normally survive for about 6 hours and in the uterus for around one week. If a sperm is successful and unites with an ovum, the cell divisions begin that create a baby. The moment one sperm fertilises an ovum is also referred to as conception. Sperm can be ejaculated, not only during sexual intercourse, but also during sleep. This is called a ‘wet dream’.
